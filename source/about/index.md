# 关于我/About Me

Everything you've ever done was done by a younger, more hopeful you who you no longer are;
Everything you aspire to do needs to be done by an older, more experienced you who you are not yet!

Story could be easier say it verbally than write it out!

Do not just promise, Prove; Do not jsut dream, Do!

Be prepared for more, be successful in all.
